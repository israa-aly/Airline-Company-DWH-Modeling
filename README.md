# Airline-Company-DWH-Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the flight activity of frequent flyers, evaluating reservation processes, and studying customer care interactions for business improvement.

## Objectives
- **Flight Activity Analysis**: Understand travel patterns, fare basis, upgrade frequency, and loyalty program engagement of frequent flyers.
  
- **Reservation Process Evaluation**: Assess profitability and efficiency of reservation processes across various channels.
  
- **Customer Care Insights**: Study customer interactions to identify inquiry types, complaint severity, and feedback.

## Modeling Approach
We are adopting the Kimball methodology with a galaxy schema type for the following reasons:
- **Focused Business Processes**: Prioritizing specific business processes relevant to flight activity and reservations.
  
- **Fast Delivery**: Kimball's methodology supports quick delivery of data-driven decision-making solutions.
  
- **Modular Data Marts**: Enhances productivity by allowing parallel development of separate data marts.
  
- **Galaxy Schema**: Suitable for sharing dimensions across data marts.
